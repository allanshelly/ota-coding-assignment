# Back-end programming assignment
In a context of hypothetical job board project, please implement following user stories using nodeJS and Typescript or modern PHP:

### User Story 1
As a job board moderator I would like to notified every time someone posts a job for a first time,  so I can properly flag it

#### Conditions of Satisfaction:
● Every time someone posts a job for a first time (based on email address), job board  moderator should be notified about it   
● Notification should contain title and description of submission, as well as links to approve  (publish) or mark it as a spam.

### User Story 2
As a Job Seeker, I would like to go to a web page and see a list of external job offers from a  specific URL combined with posts directly posted on the job board.

#### Conditions of Satisfaction:
● External API Integration: The job board should automatically fetch job listings from this [URL](https://mrge-group-gmbh.jobs.personio.de/xml )  
● Data Parsing and Display: Parse the data from the external source and display it in a user-friendly format on the job board. Each listing should at least include the job title,  description, and a link to the full job posting.

# Expectations
● Your implementation should meet the conditions of satisfaction for each user story.  
● Be prepared to share your screen and walk us through your code during the evaluation session. 
● Be ready to explain your choice of packages, architectural / design decisions, and any  challenges you encountered.  
● Have a clear understanding of your code to confidently walk us through your  implementation.
